This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Poob
A recreation of the popular board game Boop.

## Feature Progress
Currently in prototype status.

By visiting the /game page, a user can click around on the board to drop pieces for the Red player, including fully supported Boop logic.

The intended short-term goal for the MVP is to create a couch co-op game where two players could use the same client to play a simple game of boop

## Feature To-Do List
* 3-in-a-row detection
* Promote tokens to chonkers
* Switch between red and blue players
* Drag-and-drop tokens
* Lobby and Game Sessions

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
